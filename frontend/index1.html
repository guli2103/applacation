    <h2>Ferrari's story officially began in 1947 when its first road car, the 125 S, emerged from the gate of no. 4 Via Abetone Inferiore in Maranello. The iconic two-seater went on to win the Rome Grand Prix later that year and shortly thereafter was developed into a refined GT roadster. The company has travelled a long way since then, but its mission has remained unaltered: to make unique sports cars that represent the finest in Italian design and craftsmanship, both on the track and on the road. </h2>
